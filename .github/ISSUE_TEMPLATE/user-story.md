**As a** DevOps Engineer
**I need** to implement automated monitoring and alerts for our production environment
**So that** we can quickly identify and resolve issues, minimizing downtime and improving service reliability

### Details and Assumptions
* Current State: Our production environment is monitored manually, which delays incident detection and response. 
* Assumptions:
      - Monitoring tools are already selected and integrated with our infrastructure.
      - Alerting channels (e.g., Slack, email) are configured and ready.
      - The team has defined key metrics and thresholds for critical services.
### Acceptance Criteria
 - Given that the production environment is running
 - When a critical service metric exceeds its threshold (e.g., CPU usage > 90%)
 - Then an alert is automatically sent to the designated notification channel
 - And the incident is logged in our monitoring dashboard
